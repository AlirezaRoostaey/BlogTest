Auth :

using sanctum
for sending Email Otp using Mail Facade and a template located in resources/views/emails/otp.blade.php
   $emailService = new OtpEmail($name, $otp);
   $result = Mail::to($email)->send($emailService);

on the other hand save the otp code into Cache with a expiration-time of 3 min

        Cache::put($email, $otp, 3);
that when the email of user has been verified will be omitted

when email of user verified we update the user with the given data and also the field email_verified_at to now
and then we will return the accessToken of user to save it in frontEnd

we have ForgetPassword
that send otpEmail to given email
and then can verify the otp sent to email and then change the old password to given password by another web service

Admin:

first creating EnsureIsAdminMiddleware that checks the user role should be admin (we have three roles written inside UserRole enum)
NOTE : we dont have a End point for changing user role and that take place inside the tinker if i wanted to

in category we have a filed named parent_id that refers to categories.id it self
and i write a method inside Category model named childrenRecursive to get all the children of a category

then
we Have CRUD for categories and blogs
to handle the requests i have written requests rules

Client :

i write two controllers named BlogController and CategoryController
to handle the requests for client side
to see blogs and categories and change the response data inside a Resources

routes :
i put all the apis inside v1 folder to separate different versions of project and give all of them a prefix of "v1"
